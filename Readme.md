## Modes

### Base Mode (âœ…)

Allows user to configure everything as they desire according to their own needs.

### Gamified Mode (ðŸš§ðŸ”¨)

Thhis Mode introduces a gamified experience to control screen time using various fun elements like quests and goals. This mode tracks your usage and configures everything accordingly as the days pass by.

## Configuring

1. Launch DigiPaws on your Android device.
2. Provide all necessary permissions like Accessibility service, Notification, Draw over other apps etc
3. On Android 13+ devices, you need to additionally allow restricted settings before enabling the accessibility permission. Watch a tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/91B72lEpcqc?si=PCKKUSwM1aLdELqJ)
4. Configure the apps and views you want to block and set your preferences.
5. Start using your device with DigiPaws managing your screen time.


> [!TIP]  
> This app relies exclusively on accessibility services to function. Because it requires sensitive permissions, please avoid downloading it from untrusted sources.
